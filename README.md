Usage Notes

Edit the paths in $acfPath and $workshopContentPath according to where they are stored on your computer, then run the script in PowerShell.

Note: This script only applies to downloaded Steam Workshop files. It removes wallpapers downloaded from Steam and does not affect custom wallpapers that you manually added to Wallpaper Engine.
